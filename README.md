# complex-valued_neural_networks

This repository was used in my undergraduate research project [1], which consists in the study and implementation of complex-valued neural networks, covering the fundamental mathematical background, implementations in TensorFlow and experimentations with custom-made datasets and with CIFAR-10.

The most important reference used to build this code was [2], which implementation was adapted to suit the needs of the project. All other references are well-described in the research article.

My presentation in University of São Paulo International Symposium of Undergraduate Research (SIICUSP 2022) is available below:
